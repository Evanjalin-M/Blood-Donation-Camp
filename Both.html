    <blockquote> 
        <ul>
            <li>Follow Health Protocols: In case of ongoing public health concerns (e.g., COVID-19), 
                ensure that all health protocols, like mask-wearing, temperature checks, and social distancing, are followed.</li>
            <li>Sanitation: Use hand sanitizers frequently, and avoid touching your face.</li>
            <li>Emergency Procedures: Be aware of emergency procedures in case a donor experiences 
                complications. Ensure that trained medical staff are always available to handle such situations.</li>
        </ul>
