   To collect blood from voluntary donors 
   to ensure a continuous and adequate supply for medical treatments and emergencies. Blood 
   is a critical component of healthcare, used for surgeries, treating injuries, cancer 
   therapies, childbirth complications, and many other medical conditions. Since blood cannot
   be artificially manufactured, blood donation is the only way to ensure availability.</blockquote>
